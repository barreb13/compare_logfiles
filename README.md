# Project Title
Assignment 3: Log Analysis from CSS 390 Scripting Languages

# Description
This is a Python script that will take input data of 2 log files and compare them. It will generate a report that shows:
*   Segments that gained extra cookies
*   Segments that lost cookies
*   Cookies assigned to extra segments
*   Cookies omitted from segments

The program will write to standard output which will allow the user to redirect as needed

# How To Use
To use this script you need to have the script and the log files in the same directory. The script uses command line arguments. You will need to execute the script with the format of 'script' 'baseline.log' 'test-run.log' in order to achieve proper results

# Expectations
It is expected that all files will be in the same directory. The script is in an executable format and will be ran with a ./

# Reflection
This program taught me a tremendous amount of Python. I had no experience in Python. Being that I had no experience, it took me a substantial amount of time to do this. I learned how great Python can be for writing short scripts as well as longer scripts if needed. "Pythonic" code really is fun.

Through this program I learned a lot about dictionary data structures. I had no experience with dictionaries from any other programming langauge. They are extremely useful.

I could not get the script to run with Professor Bernstein's test data as my computer hardware was not capable of running it. I also tried to log into the UWB Linux Lab machines and those did not have enough RAM to run the test data either. I did however make 3 different batches of test data to use.
